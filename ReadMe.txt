NICK LAROVERE
Hi, my name is Nick! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm a born-and-raised Bostonian who recently moved out to California for work. I'm studying in the MS in Computer Science program at Johns Hopkins. I enjoy computer science, and have taken interesting courses at Johns Hopkins, such as Enterprise Web Development. In my free time, I like to study tech/entrepreneurship history, practice the Italian language, and watch a good anime. One of my favorite anime films of all time is "Your Name", which was just released in 2016. As another fun fact, I was part of a rap duo back in high school that released a few songs on Youtube.
